# Image Detection with Tensorflow
In this project we'll discuss two ways to perform image recognition:
1. [Object Detection with Boundary Boxes](https://github.com/isobar-us/multilabel-image-classification-tensorflow/tree/master/tf-object-detection-sagemaker) - 
we'll deploy Tensorflow's Object Detection API inside a Docker container to train our model inside AWS Sagemaker. The 
resulting model will be able to detect objects inside an image with a boundary box around each object. 

2. [Multi  Label Detection without boundary boxes](https://github.com/isobar-us/multilabel-image-classification-tensorflow/tree/master/tf-multi-label-detection) -
we'll be able to assign multiple labels to an image based on what it contains.
